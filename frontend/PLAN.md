## Notes Section
Track issues encountered, decisions made, technical debt, and future improvements here.

### Issues Encountered
- Vitest configuration issue with @vue/test-utils resolved by using minimal config

### Decisions Made
- Using simple in-memory cache for stores initially, will add persistence later via Pinia plugin
- Focusing on core functionality first, deferring advanced features (pagination, filters, etc.)
- School of Study Store implemented with basic functionality to maintain momentum
- UI Store implemented with TDD approach - writing tests before implementation

### Technical Debt
- Need to add Pinia persistence plugin for localStorage integration
- Cache management for School of Study store deferred
- Error handling and loading states need to be added to stores
- UI Store needs error states, toast notifications, and keyboard shortcuts support

### Future Improvements
- Implement proper cache service with TTL and LRU eviction
- Add comprehensive error handling across all stores
- Implement pagination for large datasets
