                    It can be difficult for economic planners, public officials, faculty, students, and the general public to access high quality information about the quality, availability, and accessibility of employment. 
                    This project provides a general overview of the DFW economy through use of travelshed analysis and geographical analysis.

                <p>
                    This project is divided into 4 main pages:
                    <h5>
                        Job Access by Wage Level
                    </h5>

                            Which Census tracts have the best access to jobs? What about jobs that pay a Living Wage? Or a Community Prosperity Wage? How has that changed?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This map presents summary data for all jobs, including jobs at or above key wage benchmarks. It also permits a query of previous years data, or a visualization of change from 2014 to 2024.
                        </p>

                            Which Census tracts have the best access to specific occupations? This interactive map allows you to search and explore employment accessibility by detailed occupation categories.

                        <p>
                            The occupation map features a searchable dropdown with hundreds of occupation types, from healthcare and education to technology and manufacturing, showing how transit connectivity affects access to different career paths.

                            A travelshed is the geographic area that can be reached from a specific point, within a specific
                            period of time. For example, a travelshed can show which job centers a resident from a particular
                            neighborhood could reach within an hour-long commute.

                    Credits and Methodology
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project draws extensively from the NYC Department of Planning and their "Transit Travelshed" project, which can be found 
                    <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/td-travelshed" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    
                    <p> 
                        The Spatial Jobs Index Project is developed through Mapbox Travel Time API, data from Lightcast, and more. More info about coming soon.
