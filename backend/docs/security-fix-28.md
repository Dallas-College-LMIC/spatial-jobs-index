# Security Fix: Information Leakage in Error Responses (Issue #28)

## Summary
Fixed a critical security vulnerability where internal error details were being exposed to clients in API error responses. This could potentially leak sensitive information such as database connection strings, internal file paths, or system architecture details.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Error Handlers
Modified all exception handlers in `app/main.py` to:
- Return generic error messages to clients
- Log full error details server-side for debugging
- Maintain structured error response format

### 2. Affected Endpoints
- `/occupation_ids`
- `/geojson`
- `/occupation_data/{category}`
- `/isochrones/{geoid}`
- `/school_of_study_ids`
- `/school_of_study_data/{category}`

### 3. Error Response Format
All error responses now follow this secure format:
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "message": "An internal error occurred. Please try again later.",
    "error_code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

For simple string error details:
```json
{
  "detail": "An internal error occurred. Please try again later."
}
```

### 4. Server-Side Logging
Full error details are now logged server-side with:
- Complete error message
- Stack trace (via `exc_info=True`)
- Endpoint context (e.g., "Error in get_occupation_ids")

## Testing
- Added comprehensive security tests in `tests/unit/test_error_security.py`
- Updated existing tests to expect generic error messages
- All tests pass successfully

## Security Impact
This fix prevents attackers from:
- Discovering internal database schemas
- Learning about file system structure
- Identifying technology stack details
- Exploiting error messages for reconnaissance

## Future Improvements
Consider implementing:
- Correlation IDs for better error tracking (Issue #26)
- Standardized error handling across all endpoints (Issue #30)
- Rate limiting on error responses to prevent enumeration attacks
