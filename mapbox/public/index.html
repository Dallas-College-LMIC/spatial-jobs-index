                </h1>
                <p>
                    Access to public transportation is often thought of as a binary – either you have it, or you don’t –
                    but we know it’s more complicated than that. The number of stations and types of transportation you
                    can use, where they take you and how fast they get you there, are what really matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A travelshed is the geographic area that can be reached from a specific point, within a specific
                    period of time. For example, a travelshed can show which job centers a resident from a particular
                    neighborhood could reach within an hour-long commute.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Department of City Planning (DCP) Transit Travelshed shows the areas a New Yorker can reach by
                    transit within one hour. It uses schedules of various public transit services, such as the subway,
                    to provide a measure of transit accessibility for any location in New York City.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, it can demonstrate how connected a neighborhood is to jobs, or how much commuting time
                    a proposed transit improvement could save.

                    Pick a Census tract in New York City in the next two tabs to see your transit
                    travelshed. View the <b><a href="from.html">Transit Travelshed FROM a Census Tract</a></b> to see
                    how many jobs can be accessed from the selected Census tract within 10-minute travel increments. The
                    <b><a href="to.html">Transit Travelshed TO a Census Tract</a></b> shows the total population and
                    number of workers who can travel to the selected Census tract by transit within 10-minute travel
                    increments. Click on the <b><a href="tti.html">Transit Travelshed Index</a></b> tab to find out how
                    Census Tracts across the city vary in different indices.

                    Methodology
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Transit Travelshed is developed through the open-source software OpenTripPlanner, with an input
                    of General Transit Feed Specification schedule data published by 31 major transit operating agencies
                    in the region. The model includes major public transit modes by which people get around the New York
                    City metropolitan region, such as subway, bus, rail and ferry.
